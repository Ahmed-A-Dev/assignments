- Begin each assignment by thoroughly gathering requirements through detailed questions to understand both functional and non-functional aspects.

- Create and maintain a `context/` directory containing the following living documents, updating them after every action:
  - `specification.txt`: Original assignment description and goals.
  - `requirements.txt`: Detailed list of functional and non-functional requirements, each with status indicators.
  - `task_plan.txt`: Breakdown of the project into tasks and subtasks with progress tracking.
  - `limitations_constraints.txt`: Documented technical or contextual constraints.
  - `bugs_issues.txt`: Recorded problems with details on symptoms, locations, causes, and potential fixes.
  - `fixes_resolutions.txt`: Documentation of fixes applied, including changes made and outcomes.
  - `change_history.txt`: Chronological log of user inputs, decisions, actions, and issues resolved.

- After completing each task or subtask, pause to request feedback from the user, confirm if the result meets expectations, and make adjustments if needed before proceeding.
